Transit directions can be retrieved via Google or HERE APIs. Each with it pros and cons.

Google Directions API
- .NET API already exists
- Needs to be ported to be used in Windows Phone project
- Need to figure out which Map APIs can be used to draw the directions (Google map vs Windows Phone map vs HERE map)

Nokia HERE API
- Comes with Windows Phone 8 SDK
- Doesn't need to be ported, but need to do some administrative stuff to get it to work
- HERE Transit provides public transport directions but probably doesn't have Google's reach
